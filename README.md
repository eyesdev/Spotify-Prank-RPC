# Spotify-Prank-RPC

What is spotify prank RPC? This is a spotify status for discord that when they check out the song, it plays any song link you want.
This can include earrape, prank sounds and a lot more!

# Requirements
Python 3.11
Any PC/Laptop

# How to setup? (windows computer)

**DOWNLOADING THE CODE**
First, press the big green button that says `CODE` and then press download zip.
Continue by extracting the folder to your desktop.

**SETTING THE BOT UP**
First, double click `setup.bat` when it installs the libs, close `setup.bat`

**CHANGING THE CONFIG**
Open up `config.json` as Notepad. Then go to `discord.dev` on your webbrowser and open the applications menu. Then make a new application and make a bot out of it. Reset the bot token and then copy it. Paste it into the bot token part.
Now, we also need the client ID.
To get that, press `OAuth2` and copy the client ID and paste that in there.
Now make a new server that no one is in and press `OAuth2 > Url Generator > Select bot and application.commands > Give it administrator > Invite the bot`
Then just edit the rest of the config with your stuff that you want since these are optional but required. Then just save the config and you are ready to launch the program :)

**OPENING THE PROGRAM**
There are 2 ways. I will mention both of them.
1. You can open the terminal in the same directory as the .py file and type `python run.py`
2. Just open the .py file as `Python something bit blah blah blah`
